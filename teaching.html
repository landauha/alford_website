  <h1>Teaching</h1>
  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I try to emulate all the best teachers I've ever had, and I try to do the opposite of all the bad teachers I've ever had!
      Mostly, though, I try to remember that my students are people, too, and we all have lives outside of class.
      I try not to overload them with work just for my class, and I hope that they remember that I'm not continually hanging out online waiting to immediately respond to a question they post.
      I encourage empathy in my students and myself and consider humor a valuable teaching tool.</p>

              <h3>Engr 100: Intro to Engineering, Underwater Vehicle Design</h3>
              <p>This is an intensive first-year course for engineering students that covers engineering design and technical communication.
                All first-year engineering students are required to take this class.
                There are many sections to choose from, each with its own flavor.
                Mine, as you might image, has a naval architecture and marine engineering flavor.
                I am the technical instructor for Section 600, in which students work in teams of five to build Remotely Operated Vehicles over the course of the semester as part of a design-build-test-communicate cycle.
                You will not become an expert hydrodynamicist in Engr 100-600.
                However, you will get exposure to the following engineering topics within the context of the ROV project: team communication and collaboration, 3D modeling and printing, pressure, buoyancy, stability, technical documentation (presentations and reports), basic electric circuits, systems design, probability, statistics, risk, and ethics.
                Whew!  Thank goodness I have excellent co-instructors and teaching assistants!</p>

              <h3>Engr 101: Intro to Computer Programming</h3>
              <p>Okay, so this is another course that first-year engineering students are required to take.  But this one is run a little differently than Engr 100.
                Engr 101 is run as one giant course, with about 700 students a semester, broken into 3 lectures, one of which I teach.
                But don't worry!  We have a huge team of fantastic graduate and undergraduate instructors to help us; they are from all the different engineering departments and they are eager to help you learn to harness your most powerful engineering tool: your computer.
                We focus on solving real-world engineering problems using computer programming to automate our calculations and display our data so we can make informed decisions.
                There are 6 projects that will guide you through solving engineering problems using computer programming such as error analysis, system coefficient selection, health monitoring, and delivery logistics.
                If you have experience with programming already, each project has a number of "reach goals" to keep you honing those programming skills.
                No matter what your skill level is, come hang out with us during office hours and see how truly powerful your computer can be with you at the helm (yeah, had to work in a naval arch reference there).
                I promise, I'll bring fruit snacks for when we're ready to pull out our hair because we can't find that one bug</p>

                  <h3>Hydrostatics Short Course, Naval Engineering Education Center (NEEC)</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="flip-card-back" tabindex="0">
                <p>I created a series of short video lectures on basic hydrostatics concepts for the Naval Engineering Education Center (NEEC).
                  These videos are aimed at familiarizing new Navy hires whom do not have prior ship experience with some basic ship terminology and concepts in how to keep your ship from sinking.
                  Watch the videos here.  I can't believe I'm on YouTube.
                  (Well, in an official capacity, at least.  It's not like the bar is very high for entry to YouTube.)</p>
